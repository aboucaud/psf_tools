Utils module
------------
PSF tools module gathering the main methods and functions called by the
classes and the scripts.

It contains:
* analysis.py      | Methods for analysing the image profile
* deconvolution.py | Methods for solving inverse problems
* fitting.py       | 1D and 2D PSF fitting methods
* fits.py          | Interacting with FITS files
* fourier.py       | Fourier transform
* image.py         | Methods that apply on 2D arrays
* info.py          | Get summary info on a PSF file
* misc.py          | Diverse helper methods
* plotting.py      | PSF plotting function 2D/3D plots
* profiles.py      | Common PSF profiles
